# Introduction: Beyond the Job Title

During the last few years, I have been assigned to lead multiple projects in different tech areas of the organisation I am working with. Due to the complex political context of the environment, I was not given any "Lead" title or having authority over the teams I am working with. Instead, my manager told me that I need to work it out and deliver these projects successfully. It was a very challenging task when I first started.

Often, when you're in charge of a project, you would have a team reporting directly to you and the authority from the hierarchy gives you power to drive the initative and make the decisions. I was struggled with the idea that I would not be able to deliver as I was powerless and no one would listen to me. However, I later learned that leading isn't about authority but instead about influencing others by providing guidance and support. Throughout several projects, I managed to build good connections, allies, a support network, and deliver them successfully.

You don’t become a Tech Leader because someone gave you the title, you become one when people start looking to you for guidance. In this article, I will share my experience being a Tech Leader, and the lessons I learned about influencing people, amplifying others, making decisions, and empowering the team.

# Leadership is About Influence, Not Authority



You can’t rely only on hierarchy; leadership shows up in how you inspire and enable others.

Leading by example in code quality, decision-making, and communication.

A leader sets direction but also clears obstacles.

3. Core Idea #2: Balancing People and Technology

The dual responsibility: caring for people (mentorship, communication, growth) while making sound technical decisions.

The common trap: focusing only on tech and neglecting people.

Leadership is about amplifying others rather than being the smartest in the room.

4. Core Idea #3: Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

Leaders simplify complexity, make trade-offs, and stand by decisions.

It’s less about having the “perfect answer” and more about guiding the team toward progress.

Tech leaders embrace ambiguity and help others feel confident in moving forward.

5. Core Idea #4: Creating Space for Others to Lead

Empowering others is a hallmark of real leadership.

A leader builds future leaders, not just followers.

Delegation, trust, and fostering ownership.

6. Closing: The Ongoing Journey

Leadership is a practice, not a destination.

Reflection: how you’ve grown as a Tech Leader, and what you continue to learn.

Closing hook: “Being a Tech Leader isn’t about being in front. It’s about creating a path so others can walk confidently beside you.”
