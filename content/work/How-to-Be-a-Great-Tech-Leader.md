## Introduction: Beyond the Job Title

During the last few years, I have been assigned to lead multiple projects in different tech areas of the organisation I am working with. Due to the complex political context of the environment, I was not given any "Lead" title or having authority over the teams I am working with. Instead, my manager told me that I need to work it out and deliver these projects successfully. It was a very challenging task when I first started.

Often, when you're in charge of a project, you would have a team reporting directly to you and the authority from the hierarchy gives you power to drive the initative and make the decisions. I was struggled with the idea that I would not be able to deliver as I was powerless and no one would listen to me. However, I later learned that leading isn't about authority but instead about influencing others by providing guidance and support. Throughout several projects, I managed to build good connections, allies, a support network, and deliver them successfully.

You don’t become a Tech Leader because someone gave you the title, you become one when people start looking to you for guidance. In this article, I will share my experience being a Tech Leader, and the lessons I learned about influencing people, amplifying others, making decisions, and empowering the team.

## Leadership is About Influence, Not Authority

Authority is a very limited tool as your circle of influence will be confined within the group of people you're managing. Solely relying on hierarchy power will limit your influence in complex and multi-discipline projects. Leadership is never about telling people what to do, but rather work with them side-by-side to define the "WHAT" and empower them to come up with the "HOW".

I won trust and support from people I worked with by offering them support when it comes to technical challenges, internal process roadblocks, and disagreement facilitations. I often think of myself as someone clearing all the obstacles ten miles ahead so that my team can move forward instead of a manager on the back seat. I use my technical expertise and vision to anticipate what might come next to enable and inspire others. That's how I win influence without having authority.

## Balancing People and Technology

Being a tech leader means you have dual responsibility: caring for your people while making good technical decisions. When designing a solution or choosing technical approach, I always consider the skill gaps of the team and how to help them bridge those gaps. On one hand, I have to deliver a solution on time using modern technologies. On the other hand, I need to plan and allow sufficient time so that the team can upskill along the way.

The common trap is to focus only on tech, aim for technical perfection and ignore people. You need to mentor and help your team grow. In one project using Modern Data Stack within enterprise environment, I still remember the team was struggling to build and release one data pipeline in two months. Not long after, they can release 10 pipelines in two weeks.

Team performance is the average of individual performance. Therefore, I believe that leadership is about amplifying others rather than being the smartest in the room.

## Decision-Making Under Uncertainty




Leaders simplify complexity, make trade-offs, and stand by decisions.

It’s less about having the “perfect answer” and more about guiding the team toward progress.

Tech leaders embrace ambiguity and help others feel confident in moving forward.

## Creating Space for Others to Lead

Empowering others is a hallmark of real leadership.

A leader builds future leaders, not just followers.

Delegation, trust, and fostering ownership.

## The Ongoing Journey

Leadership is a practice, not a destination.

Reflection: how you’ve grown as a Tech Leader, and what you continue to learn.

Closing hook: “Being a Tech Leader isn’t about being in front. It’s about creating a path so others can walk confidently beside you.”
