## Introduction: Beyond the Job Title

Over the last few years, I have been assigned to lead multiple projects across different tech areas in my organisation. Because of the complex political context of the environment, I wasn't given a formal "Lead" title or any authority over the teams I worked with. Instead, my manager told me to work it out and deliver these projects successfully. It was a very challenging task when I first started.

When you're in charge of a project, you usually have a team reporting directly to you, and the authority from the hierarchy gives you power to drive initiatives and make decisions. I struggled with the idea that I might not be able to deliver as I was powerless and no one would listen to me. But over time, I learned that leadership isn't about authority but instead about influencing others by providing guidance and support.

Through several projects, I built connections, allies, a support network, and together, we delivered successfully.

That’s when I learned: you don’t become a Tech Leader because someone gave you the title, you become one when people start looking to you for guidance.

In this article, I'll share my experience being a Tech Leader, and the lessons I learned about influencing people, amplifying others, making decisions, and empowering the team.

## Leadership is About Influence, Not Authority

The challenge taught me my first lesson: leadership is about influence, not authority. Authority is a very limited tool as your circle of influence is confined to the people you manage. Relying solely on hierarchical power limits your influence in complex, multidisciplinary projects. Leadership is never about commanding people to do something, but about working with them side by side to define the "WHAT" and empower them to determine the "HOW".

I earned trust and support from the people I worked with by helping them navigate technical challenges, process roadblocks, and conflicts. I often think of myself as someone clearing all the obstacles ten miles ahead so that my team can move forward instead of a manager on the back seat. I use my technical expertise and vision to anticipate what might come next, to enable and inspire others. That's how I build influence without authority.

## Balancing People and Technology

With the power of influence comes greater responsibility. Being a tech leader means carrying a dual responsibility: caring for your people while making sound technical decisions.

When designing a solution or choosing a technical approach, I always consider the skill gaps of the team and how to help them bridge those gaps. On one hand, I need to deliver solutions on time using modern technologies. On the other hand, I must create space for the team to upskill along the way.

The common trap is to focus only on tech, aim for technical perfection while ignoring people. You need to mentor and help your team grow.

In one project using Modern Data Stack within an enterprise environment, I still remember how the team struggled to build and release one data pipeline in two months. Not long after, they were releasing ten pipelines in two weeks.

Team performance is the average of individual performance. Therefore, I believe that leadership is about amplifying others, rather than being the smartest in the room.

## Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

While software systems are expected to behave deterministically, the decisions made during their design and delivery often involve uncertainty.

For example, you know that running the data pipeline 1000 times should give exactly the same result for the same input, but it is far less certain whether choosing data processing engine A or B will guarantee success if you're the first to adopt it in your organisation.

In such scenarios, the team looks to you for guidance. Your responsibility is to simplify complexity, make trade-offs, and stand by your decisions. I often use structured decision-making frameworks such as PrOACT to objectively benchmark the options, weigh trade-offs, and guide the team toward progress rather than finding the “perfect answer”.

Of course, every decision comes with consequences and trade-offs. But you must stand by them, be accountable, and prepare mitigation strategies. After all, tech leaders embrace ambiguity and help others feel confident in moving forward.

## Creating Space for Others to Lead

In complex projects, you'll never have enough time or energy to be involved in every decision. The paradox of focus is if you zoom too close into the details, you lose sight of the bigger picture.

The most sustainable way of leading is to empower others to lead. In other words, build future leaders, not followers.

It's like teaching someone to drive. You need to be there with them in the early stages of the process, but eventually, you must trust them to drive on their own while keeping an eye on the road ahead for risks. You have to give up control, avoid micro-management, trust your crew, let them drive while providing overwatch and clearing roadblocks ahead.

## The Ongoing Journey

I used to think that Tech Leader is a role, a milestone, a destination. However, the experience I had during the last few years has taught me that leadership is a journey and we all have to practice along the way, regardless of our titles or roles.

I started by helping others, being responsible, and taking full ownership of everything I did. Over time, I gained experience, built knowledge, and became a trusted advisor to my team.

I believe the best way to learn is to do, and the best way to lead is to do it with your team.

Finally, being a Tech Leader isn’t about being in front. It’s about creating a path so others can walk confidently beside you. Leadership begins long before the job title, and it never ends there.
